# bookWorm

This project aims at finding new and innovative ways to read books.

The main idea is to help reduce eye-stress from reading by creating a system which allows a more natural flow for receiving information from text.

The first idea being developed is to make a sort of space-filling curve from text, so that one may continue reading without having to restart from a new line.

Example:

This is my very own custom                              >───────────\
example sentence that is meant          ->         >───────────\
to be read "normally".                                         >───────────

<br />

This is my very own custom                              >───────────┐\
example sentence that is meant           ->          ┌──────────┘\
to be read in a "new" way.                                   └───────────

<br />

Hence the name bookWorm.
